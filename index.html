		<strong>Hello, and welcome to my page! I hope that you find a common interest or learn something new while visiting my website.

				<h2>Get to know O</h2>
				<p>I was born and raised in Kansas City, KS, the oldest of three. I joined the United States Air Force at 19 and completed eight years of service. After separating from Nellis AFB, I stayed in Las Vegas for five years and met my wife. We've been together for almost five years, and we have one toddler, a two-year-old son, a baby girl due in January 2023, and our dog (mini-schnauzer) named YÃ¨. In my leisure time, I love to travel and see my friends from the military or take a road trip. Also, I thoroughly enjoy the music! Whether that is watching bio-pics, documentaries, old concerts, or learning an artist's body of work. One of my favorites is Stevie Wonder! I love his music because he has a catalog where I'm sure the only person who knows his songs is him. </p>

				<h2>Career & Future Career Goals</h2>
				<p>While serving in the USAF, my primary job was in Security Forces. Still, I spent most of my career as a dispatcher or an executive assistant. A fun fact about me is that;  back in 2014, I served a year-long tour of duty at Osan Air Base. I was selected out of five candidates (who all outranked me at the time) to be an Executive Assistant to my Commander. The 51st Security Forces Squadron is the largest Security Forces unit in the Pacific Air Force and was established in 1950. I was the first black male executive assistant in the entire history of that squadron's existence. Once I separated in 2016, I focused on school and worked in a few different positions. What common trend I started noticing in all of my jobs is that I was always the go-to tech guy. It took me some time, but I realized I had a tech niche and should build on that foundation. Currently, I'm completing my B.S. in Computer Science at South Western College in Kansas with only six classes remaining. Also, I've begun studying for my "Comp-tia Security +"  certification. My goal for 2023 is to complete my degree and obtain my first certification simultaneously to jump into my tech career. Further down the road, I would like to complete my Master's in Public Administration and start a non-profit within the inner city that assists children in the inner city in obtaining those tech certifications that don't require a college</p>

				<h2>My Page </h2>
				<p>My wife and I wanted to get married years ago, but due to the pandemic and also having our son, we had to continue to postpone those plans. However, recently we had our wedding in May of 2022, and it was a success! I know it's a common idea that the groom doesn't do much during the wedding planning process; however, that is a myth! The process is more straightforward when the groom gives input on wedding decisions because it takes the pressure off the bride. There is a lot learned during that process, and I would like to offer that service to other grooms who will be tying the knot soon. Please let me know if you have any questions about suits, vendors, saving money, etc.! Also, if you're a bride and you might have questions regarding cost or other expenses, you can also reach out to me.</p>

				<h2> Are You A Groom About to Get Married?</h2>
				<p>As I stated previously, I became a Husband this year to my now wife, Asia. Initially, when we started planning, I thought what most men think: "I will just take the back seat," but I quickly learned that is the wrong attitude to have. Just think, this is your big day too! All your friends and family will witness you take one of the most significant steps in your life, so why not have a little input? Overall the process can be stressful, but hopefully, with guidance, you can change that.</p>
				<h3>Your Suit, Your Best Man's Suit, and Your Groomsmen Suits</h3>
				<p>When choosing your suit, remember that you can't outshine your Bride but everyone else...upstage them all! As you can see in my photo, I wore a white suit with gold and almond undertones. When choosing your suit, ask your wife about the colors in her dress. Knowing this information will ensure you compliment the Bride, especially when photos are being taken. Your suit should be something simple but not as simple as the best man or groomsman. Again, you want to stand out on your big day! For your Bestman and your Groomsmen, think about the wedding colors and try to select the earth tone or best accent color in your color wedding color scheme. For example, our colors were white, gold, sage, and burnt orange. Of course, the Bride & groom wore white, the  bridesmaids wore sage, and the groomsmen wore burnt orange suits with sage bowties to compliment the bridesmaids.</p>
				<h3>Ties, Shoes, Boutonnieres, & More</h3>
				<p> These items are cheaper than suits but are also the most commonly forgotten on the wedding day. It's a custom for you to buy your groomsmen a gift for the wedding (considering all that they will be paying for travel, bachelor party, etc.). So I decided to buy my groomsmen their shoes, bowties, and accessories. Doing this ensured my groomsmen had a uniform look and that no of them forgot any of the needed items for the wedding day.</p>
