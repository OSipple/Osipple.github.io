About me!<br />
<p>Hello, my name is Orlando, and I am the creative behind Men's Best Dress For Less. I am 
a husband, father, veteran, son, brother, college, and friend. I enjoy spending time with my family
and binge-watching a good Netflix special when I am not working. Born and raised in Kansas City and being exposed to the family and jazz culture
impacted my style quite a bit.</p>

<p> Growing up, my mom always dressed my younger brother (two years apart) like me. It was something I did not enjoy and 
I made sure my mother knew often. However, I did not win that battle ever. Entering the 12th grade, I became familiar with 
rapper and producer Kanye West. Listening to his music was everything I was going to say eventually, but I did not know how.
Listening to his music and watching him on T.V., I became inspired by how West did not allow anyone to dictate who he was or
was going to be. All of this showed in his fashion. He started trends that may not have been popular, but eventually, everyone else 
would be inspired to do the same.</p>

<p>Witnessing that type of independence from someone I can relate to quickly became my motivation. I began looking at magazines,
watching music videos, and watching people. Even with my hairstyles, I always lead from the front. That Mohawk in 9th grade still haunts me.
Nevertheless, I started being recognized as stylish throughout my life. When I was younger, I didn't know how to embrace my sense of style
because I always felt there was an expectation. Now being older, I have learned to give style and comfort balance.</p>
